        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>The Whitman Cranberry Farm, a family-run cranberry farm in the sleepy village of Cranberryville, is where
            Cranberry Co.
            first began. The Whitman family had been raising cranberries for many generations, and their dedication to
            excellence laid the groundwork for Cranberry Co.</p>

            are more than just a fruit; they stand for harmony and community.
            We hope to promote happiness, foster relationships, and provide special moments through our products.</p>
